# 📊 Care Transition Efficiency & Placement Outcome Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Care Transition Efficiency** of the **Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Program** by examining the movement of children through the care pipeline from **Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** custody to **Health and Human Services (HHS)** care and finally to **Sponsor Placement**.

The project focuses on measuring operational efficiency, identifying process bottlenecks, monitoring backlog accumulation, and evaluating placement outcomes through Business Analytics techniques.

An interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** has been developed to visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), trends, and operational performance.

# 🎯 Business Problem

Traditional reporting primarily tracks the number of children in custody but does not measure the efficiency of transitions across the care pipeline.

This project addresses important operational questions such as:

* How efficiently are children transferred from CBP to HHS?
* Are sponsor placements keeping pace with new arrivals?
* Where do operational bottlenecks occur?
* How stable are placement outcomes over time?

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

## Primary Objectives

* Measure Transfer Efficiency (CBP → HHS)
* Evaluate Discharge Effectiveness
* Detect Operational Bottlenecks
* Measure Pipeline Throughput

## Secondary Objectives

* Improve Case Management
* Support Faster Reunification
* Enhance Operational Monitoring
* Provide Data-Driven Insights

# 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains daily operational records of the UAC Program.

| Column                                         | Description           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Date                                           | Reporting Date        |
| Children apprehended and placed in CBP custody | Daily Intake          |
| Children in CBP Custody                        | Active CBP Population |
| Children transferred out of CBP custody        | Daily Transfers       |
| Children in HHS Care                           | Active HHS Population |
| Children discharged from HHS Care              | Sponsor Placements    |
