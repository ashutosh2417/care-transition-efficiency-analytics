# 📊 Care Transition Efficiency & Placement Outcome Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Care Transition Efficiency** of the **Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Program** by examining the movement of children through the care pipeline from **Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** custody to **Health and Human Services (HHS)** care and finally to **Sponsor Placement**.

The project focuses on measuring operational efficiency, identifying process bottlenecks, monitoring backlog accumulation, and evaluating placement outcomes through Business Analytics techniques.

An interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** has been developed to visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), trends, and operational performance.

## 🎓 Internship Project

**This project was successfully completed as part of my Business Analytics Internship at Unified Mentor.**

During this internship, I designed and developed the **Care Transition Efficiency & Placement Outcome Analytics** system, an end-to-end Business Analytics solution for evaluating the operational efficiency of the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) care pipeline. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, KPI development, operational performance analysis, interactive dashboard creation, and cloud deployment using Streamlit. The dashboard enables monitoring of care transition efficiency, backlog accumulation, throughput, and placement outcomes to support data-driven decision-making.

### **Skills Demonstrated**
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- KPI Development & Performance Analytics
- Business Analytics & Data Visualization
- Operational Process Analysis
- Interactive Dashboard Development (Streamlit)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- GitHub Version Control
- Cloud Deployment using Streamlit

# 🎯 Business Problem

Traditional reporting primarily tracks the number of children in custody but does not measure the efficiency of transitions across the care pipeline.

This project addresses important operational questions such as:

* How efficiently are children transferred from CBP to HHS?
* Are sponsor placements keeping pace with new arrivals?
* Where do operational bottlenecks occur?
* How stable are placement outcomes over time?

# 🎯 Project Objectives

## Primary Objectives

* Measure Transfer Efficiency (CBP → HHS)
* Evaluate Discharge Effectiveness
* Detect Operational Bottlenecks
* Measure Pipeline Throughput

## Secondary Objectives

* Improve Case Management
* Support Faster Reunification
* Enhance Operational Monitoring
* Provide Data-Driven Insights

# 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains daily operational records of the UAC Program.

| Column                                         | Description           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Date                                           | Reporting Date        |
| Children apprehended and placed in CBP custody | Daily Intake          |
| Children in CBP Custody                        | Active CBP Population |
| Children transferred out of CBP custody        | Daily Transfers       |
| Children in HHS Care                           | Active HHS Population |
| Children discharged from HHS Care              | Sponsor Placements    |
